## Codebase Patterns
- Use quoted column names for camelCase (e.g., "firstName", "createdAt")
- Table names are quoted and PascalCase (e.g., "Player", "User")
- Use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations to ensure idempotency
- UUID primary keys use `gen_random_uuid()` for defaults
- Always add useful indexes for common query patterns
- Junction tables use `ON DELETE CASCADE` for both foreign keys
- User.id is INTEGER (SERIAL), Player.id is UUID - match types in foreign keys
- Zod v4: access validation errors via `parsed.error.issues[0]`, not `.errors`
- Supabase join syntax for relations: `player:Player(*)` for junction tables
- Use `ReturnType<typeof createServerClient>` for SupabaseClient type in route handlers

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created Player table migration with UUID primary key
- Files changed: supabase/migrations/20260115181252_create_player_table.sql
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow existing naming conventions: quoted PascalCase tables, quoted camelCase columns
  - Use `IF NOT EXISTS` for safer migrations
  - Add indexes for columns used in ORDER BY and WHERE clauses

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created UserPlayer junction table migration with composite primary key
- Files changed: supabase/migrations/20260115181431_create_user_player_table.sql
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - User table uses SERIAL (integer) for id, Player uses UUID - junction tables must match these types
  - Use `ON DELETE CASCADE` for junction tables so deleting a user/player automatically removes the link
  - Composite primary key syntax: `PRIMARY KEY ("column1", "column2")`

## 2026-01-15 18:20 - US-003
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Added Player and UserPlayer TypeScript interfaces to lib/types/database.ts
- Files changed: lib/types/database.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Player.id is string (UUID), UserPlayer.playerId is string to match
  - User.id is number (INTEGER), UserPlayer.userId is number to match
  - Follow existing interface patterns in database.ts (JSDoc comments, consistent field naming)

## 2026-01-15 18:30 - US-004
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created player server actions file with 'use server' directive
- Implemented getPlayers(), createPlayer(), linkPlayerToUser(), getUserPlayers()
- Files changed: app/actions/players.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Zod errors are accessed via `.issues` not `.errors` in zod v4
  - Use generic ActionResult<T> type for actions that return data
  - Follow existing patterns in cart.ts for getCurrentUserId() helper
  - Use Supabase join syntax `player:Player(*)` for junction table queries
  - Add explicit types to filter callbacks to satisfy noImplicitAny
---

## 2026-01-15 18:45 - US-005
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created player selection page server component at app/onboarding/player/page.tsx
- Implemented auth check with redirect to /login if not authenticated
- Implemented linked players check with redirect to / if user already has players
- Fetches all players via getPlayers() and prepares for client component integration
- Page title set to "Select Your Player"
- Files changed: app/onboarding/player/page.tsx, ralph/prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow checkout/page.tsx pattern for auth checks: supabase.auth.getUser() → redirect("/login")
  - getUserPlayers() returns ActionResult with optional data array - check for length > 0
  - Placeholder div for client component that will be integrated in US-006
---

## 2026-01-15 19:10 - US-006
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created PlayerSelection client component with multi-select checkboxes
- Displays list of existing players (firstName, lastName, jerseyNumber)
- Players in scrollable list with proper label/checkbox associations for accessibility
- 'Add New Player' button reveals AddPlayerForm component
- 'Continue' button disabled until selection made, calls linkPlayerToUser for each
- Loading state with "Linking..." text while processing
- Integrated into onboarding/player/page.tsx server component
- Files changed: components/onboarding/player-selection.tsx, app/onboarding/player/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Labels wrapping checkboxes need htmlFor and id for Biome accessibility rules
  - Use `{players.map((player) => { const id = ...; return ... })}` pattern for dynamic IDs
  - useTransition + useRouter for async actions followed by navigation
  - State management: Set<string> for multi-select tracking
---

## 2026-01-15 19:10 - US-007
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created AddPlayerForm client component (implemented alongside US-006)
- Form fields: firstName, lastName, jerseyNumber with required validation
- Submit calls createPlayer action, success triggers onSuccess callback
- Error state displayed when creation fails
- Loading state with "Adding..." text while submitting
- Cancel button to close without adding
- Files changed: components/onboarding/add-player-form.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use form action={handleSubmit} with FormData for server actions
  - useTransition provides isPending state for loading indicators
  - onSuccess callback pattern allows parent to update state (add to selected list)
---

## 2026-01-15 19:30 - US-008
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Modified auth callback to redirect new users without linked players
- After auth completes, queries UserPlayer table to check for linked players
- If no linked players: redirects to /onboarding/player
- If has linked players: redirects to / (existing behavior)
- Refactored auth callback to reduce cognitive complexity (extracted helper functions)
- Files changed: app/auth/callback/route.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `ReturnType<typeof createServerClient>` for Supabase client type (not exported directly from @supabase/ssr)
  - Extract helper functions to reduce cognitive complexity below 20 (Biome limit)
  - Result types with discriminated unions: `{ userId: number } | { error: NextResponse }` for typed error handling
  - For new user inserts, chain `.select("id").single()` to get the auto-generated ID
  - On error checking linked players, default to allowing access (return true) to avoid blocking users

## Codebase Patterns
- Use runtime validation for env vars instead of `!` non-null assertions (ultracite forbids them)
- When creating Supabase clients, always check that NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY exist before using them
- ZodError uses `.issues` (not `.errors`) to access validation error messages
- Server-side Supabase client uses cookies() from next/headers (must be awaited in Next.js 16)
- Biome/ultracite forbids nested ternary expressions - extract to helper functions with if/else
- Dynamic route params in Next.js 16 are a Promise that must be awaited
- Use Number.parseInt(id, 10) with Number.isNaN() for safe ID parsing
- The Item type already has `imageStoragePath: string | null` and `imageUrl: string | null` fields

- react-dropzone useDropzone hook provides getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive for easy drag-and-drop implementation
- File selection state should be tracked with useState<File | null> and passed via FormData on submit
- Use Next.js Image component with `unoptimized` prop for blob URLs (local file previews)
- URL.createObjectURL() for local file previews - must be cleaned up with URL.revokeObjectURL() in useEffect cleanup
- Supabase Storage: upload with `supabase.storage.from(bucket).upload(path, file, { upsert: true })`, get URL with `.getPublicUrl(path)`
- Check `formData.get("field") instanceof File && file.size > 0` to detect actual file uploads (empty files have size 0)
- Next.js Image remotePatterns in next.config.ts must include external domains (e.g., *.supabase.co for Supabase Storage)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented:
  - ProductCard component already had image display logic in place from prior work
  - Added Supabase Storage domain wildcard (*.supabase.co) to next.config.ts remotePatterns
  - This enables Next.js Image optimization for Supabase-hosted product images
- Files changed:
  - next.config.ts (added Supabase remote pattern for Image component)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js Image component requires remote domains to be whitelisted in next.config.ts remotePatterns
  - Use wildcard hostname pattern (*.supabase.co) to cover all Supabase project domains
  - Always check next.config.ts when adding new image sources

## 2026-01-16 - US-005
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented:
  - Modified createItem server action to handle image file uploads
  - Insert item first with .select("id").single() to get new item ID
  - Upload image to items/{itemId}/{filename} using existing uploadImage helper
  - Update item record with imageStoragePath and imageUrl after upload
  - Added error handling with cleanup (deletes uploaded image if update fails)
- Files changed:
  - app/admin/items/actions.ts (updated createItem to handle image uploads)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Supabase insert can chain .select() and .single() to return the new record
  - For create flows with file uploads: insert first, get ID, upload, then update with file paths
  - Always clean up uploaded files if subsequent database operations fail
---

## 2026-01-16 - US-004
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented:
  - Added uploadImage() helper to upload files to Supabase Storage
  - Added deleteImage() helper to remove files from storage
  - Modified updateItem server action to handle image FormData
  - Uploads new images to product-images bucket at items/{itemId}/{filename}
  - Deletes old images when replacing or when shouldDelete is true
  - Preserves existing image values when no change is made
  - Uses upsert: true on upload to allow replacing same-named files
- Files changed:
  - app/admin/items/actions.ts (added image upload/delete helpers, updated updateItem)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Supabase Storage upload uses supabase.storage.from(bucket).upload(path, file, options)
  - getPublicUrl() returns { data: { publicUrl } } - no error property
  - Use Record<string, unknown> for dynamic update objects to avoid type issues
  - Check imageFile instanceof File && imageFile.size > 0 to detect real file uploads

## 2026-01-15 - US-003
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented:
  - Added image preview using Next.js Image component (max 200x200, object-contain)
  - Shows existing image from item.imageUrl when editing
  - Added remove button with X icon positioned at top-right corner
  - Implemented three-state image tracking: newFile, existingUrl, shouldDelete
  - When removing: clears newFile, sets shouldDelete=true if existingUrl existed
  - Form submission includes deleteImage flag when shouldDelete is true
- Files changed:
  - components/admin/items/item-form.tsx (added preview, remove button, state management)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeScript narrowing requires direct variable checks (displayImageUrl ? ...) not derived booleans
  - Biome requires Next.js Image instead of <img> - use unoptimized={true} for blob URLs
  - useEffect cleanup returns function to URL.revokeObjectURL() the blob URL

## 2026-01-15 - US-002
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented:
  - Installed react-dropzone package
  - Added dropzone component at top of ItemForm (before Name field)
  - Configured for image/* with visual feedback on drag (border/background change)
  - Uses Lucide Upload icon in placeholder
  - Shows selected file name after selection
  - File included in FormData on submit
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added react-dropzone)
  - bun.lock (updated)
  - components/admin/items/item-form.tsx (added dropzone UI and state)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - react-dropzone accept format is { "image/*": [] } for all image types
  - isDragActive boolean triggers visual hover state
  - getRootProps() and getInputProps() wire up the div and hidden input
  - File state must be managed separately and appended to FormData

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented:
  - Created SQL migration for 'product-images' Supabase Storage bucket
  - Configured bucket with public read access (public: true)
  - Added policies for public SELECT, authenticated INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- Files changed:
  - supabase/migrations/20260115184437_create_product_images_bucket.sql (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Supabase Storage buckets are created via INSERT INTO storage.buckets
  - Policies use storage.objects table with bucket_id condition
  - auth.role() = 'authenticated' checks for logged-in users in policies
