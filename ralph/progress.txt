## Codebase Patterns
- User table column names are lowercase: `supabaseid`, `isadmin` (not camelCase)
- Player table uses camelCase: `firstName`, `lastName`, `jerseyNumber`
- Item table uses camelCase: `costCents`, `imageUrl`, `displayOrder`
- All prices stored in cents (e.g., 5000 = $50.00)
- Item.sizes is a TEXT[] PostgreSQL array
- Order lifecycle: DRAFT → OPEN → ORDERED → RECEIVED
