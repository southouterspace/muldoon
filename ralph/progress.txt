# Ralph Progress Log - Performance Optimization

Branch: ralph/performance-optimization
Started: 2026-01-16

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `Promise.all()` to parallelize independent Supabase queries for better performance
- Supabase query results can be destructured after Promise.all: `const { data, error } = result`
- Use `getCachedUser()` from `lib/supabase/cached.ts` for deduplicated auth calls in server components
- Use `after()` from "next/server" for non-blocking background work (e.g., sending emails after redirect)
- Use discriminated union types (with `status` field) for functions that can return multiple outcomes, to avoid redundant null-checks
- When queries have data dependencies, use Supabase nested selects to combine into a single query (e.g., `user:User (email, userPlayers:UserPlayer (...))`)
- TypeScript check: `bunx tsc --noEmit`
- Lint check: `bun x ultracite check`
- Build: `bun run build`

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Parallelized orders and orderItems queries in admin orders page
- Wrapped both Supabase queries in Promise.all() for concurrent execution
- Files changed: app/admin/orders/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern: Wrap independent Supabase queries in Promise.all(), then destructure results separately
  - The Ultracite linter auto-formats code on save/commit
  - Project uses lefthook for pre-commit hooks that run ultracite fix

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Parallelized batch item position updates in moveToPosition function
- Refactored sequential for-loop to use Promise.all() with map
- Error handling checks for any failed update in the batch using .find()
- Files changed: app/admin/items/actions.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When mapping over an array in Promise.all(), TypeScript needs explicit type annotation for the callback parameter if noImplicitAny is enabled
  - Pattern: Use `.find((result) => result.error)` to detect any failures in a batch of Supabase operations

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented React.cache() wrapper for auth deduplication
- Created lib/supabase/cached.ts with getCachedUser() function
- Files changed: lib/supabase/cached.ts (new file)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - React.cache() deduplicates calls within a single request lifecycle
  - Import `cache` from "react" (not "react/cache")
  - The cached function returns the same Promise as supabase.auth.getUser(), so existing destructuring patterns work unchanged

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Replaced direct supabase.auth.getUser() with getCachedUser() in server components
- Updated app/(main)/page.tsx, app/(main)/cart/page.tsx, and app/admin/layout.tsx
- Admin layout still uses createClient() for the admin check query, but auth is now cached
- Files changed: app/(main)/page.tsx, app/(main)/cart/page.tsx, app/admin/layout.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The Ultracite linter removes unused imports automatically - must add import and usage in the same edit or the import will be removed before usage can be added
  - getCachedUser() has the same return type as supabase.auth.getUser(), so destructuring patterns remain unchanged
  - The admin layout has two auth calls - one in getAdminUser() and a fallback in the layout itself - both should use the cached version

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented non-blocking email with Next.js after() function
- Moved email sending logic inside after() callback so checkout redirect happens immediately
- Captured order data in snapshot variables before after() callback to ensure data is available when callback executes
- Removed console.error in catch block to avoid unused variable lint error (email errors silently ignored per acceptance criteria)
- Files changed: app/actions/checkout.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `after()` from "next/server" schedules work to run after the response is sent to the client
  - Variables used inside after() callback must be captured outside the callback (closures over request-scoped data)
  - The Ultracite linter requires unused catch error parameters to be omitted (use `catch {` instead of `catch (error) {`)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Fixed duplicate auth calls in admin layout by returning richer context from getAdminUser()
- Created discriminated union type AdminUserResult with three states: admin, authenticated_not_admin, unauthenticated
- Eliminated redundant getCachedUser() call in layout that was used to determine redirect destination
- Now only one auth call (via getCachedUser()) and one admin check query (via createClient()) per request
- Files changed: app/admin/layout.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use discriminated union types to return richer context from helper functions instead of null-checking
  - TypeScript's control flow analysis narrows discriminated union types after redirect() calls (since redirect returns `never`)
  - This pattern avoids try-catch in helper functions - the discriminated union explicitly represents all possible states

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Optimized order detail page by combining two sequential queries into one nested query
- Extended the Order query to include `user.userPlayers.player` in a single database round trip
- Updated OrderFromDb interface to reflect the new nested structure
- Reduced database round trips from 2 to 1
- Files changed: app/admin/orders/[orderId]/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When queries have data dependencies (query B needs result from query A), Promise.all is not possible
  - Supabase nested selects (e.g., `user:User (email, userPlayers:UserPlayer (player:Player (...)))`) can combine dependent queries into one
  - Single nested query is often superior to Promise.all because it reduces DB round trips
  - Always analyze query dependencies before choosing parallelization vs combination strategy

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Deleted unused demo component: components/component-example.tsx
- Verified no imports reference the file (only PRD and tasks doc mentioned it)
- Build and typecheck both pass
- Files changed: components/component-example.tsx (deleted)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use grep pattern `from.*filename|import.*ComponentName` to find actual code imports
  - Documentation files (PRD, tasks) mentioning a file don't count as dependencies
