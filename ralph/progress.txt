## Codebase Patterns
- Use quoted column names for camelCase (e.g., "firstName", "createdAt")
- Table names are quoted and PascalCase (e.g., "Player", "User")
- Use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations to ensure idempotency
- UUID primary keys use `gen_random_uuid()` for defaults
- Always add useful indexes for common query patterns
- Junction tables use `ON DELETE CASCADE` for both foreign keys
- User.id is INTEGER (SERIAL), Player.id is UUID - match types in foreign keys
- Zod v4: access validation errors via `parsed.error.issues[0]`, not `.errors`
- Supabase join syntax for relations: `player:Player(*)` for junction tables
- Use `ReturnType<typeof createServerClient>` for SupabaseClient type in route handlers

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created Player table migration with UUID primary key
- Files changed: supabase/migrations/20260115181252_create_player_table.sql
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow existing naming conventions: quoted PascalCase tables, quoted camelCase columns
  - Use `IF NOT EXISTS` for safer migrations
  - Add indexes for columns used in ORDER BY and WHERE clauses

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created UserPlayer junction table migration with composite primary key
- Files changed: supabase/migrations/20260115181431_create_user_player_table.sql
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - User table uses SERIAL (integer) for id, Player uses UUID - junction tables must match these types
  - Use `ON DELETE CASCADE` for junction tables so deleting a user/player automatically removes the link
  - Composite primary key syntax: `PRIMARY KEY ("column1", "column2")`

## 2026-01-15 18:20 - US-003
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Added Player and UserPlayer TypeScript interfaces to lib/types/database.ts
- Files changed: lib/types/database.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Player.id is string (UUID), UserPlayer.playerId is string to match
  - User.id is number (INTEGER), UserPlayer.userId is number to match
  - Follow existing interface patterns in database.ts (JSDoc comments, consistent field naming)

## 2026-01-15 18:30 - US-004
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created player server actions file with 'use server' directive
- Implemented getPlayers(), createPlayer(), linkPlayerToUser(), getUserPlayers()
- Files changed: app/actions/players.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Zod errors are accessed via `.issues` not `.errors` in zod v4
  - Use generic ActionResult<T> type for actions that return data
  - Follow existing patterns in cart.ts for getCurrentUserId() helper
  - Use Supabase join syntax `player:Player(*)` for junction table queries
  - Add explicit types to filter callbacks to satisfy noImplicitAny

## 2026-01-15 18:45 - US-005
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created player selection page server component at app/onboarding/player/page.tsx
- Implemented auth check with redirect to /login if not authenticated
- Implemented linked players check with redirect to / if user already has players
- Fetches all players via getPlayers() and prepares for client component integration
- Page title set to "Select Your Player"
- Files changed: app/onboarding/player/page.tsx, ralph/prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow checkout/page.tsx pattern for auth checks: supabase.auth.getUser() → redirect("/login")
  - getUserPlayers() returns ActionResult with optional data array - check for length > 0
  - Placeholder div for client component that will be integrated in US-006

## 2026-01-15 19:10 - US-006
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created PlayerSelection client component with multi-select checkboxes
- Displays list of existing players (firstName, lastName, jerseyNumber)
- Players in scrollable list with proper label/checkbox associations for accessibility
- 'Add New Player' button reveals AddPlayerForm component
- 'Continue' button disabled until selection made, calls linkPlayerToUser for each
- Loading state with "Linking..." text while processing
- Integrated into onboarding/player/page.tsx server component
- Files changed: components/onboarding/player-selection.tsx, app/onboarding/player/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Labels wrapping checkboxes need htmlFor and id for Biome accessibility rules
  - Use `{players.map((player) => { const id = ...; return ... })}` pattern for dynamic IDs
  - useTransition + useRouter for async actions followed by navigation
  - State management: Set<string> for multi-select tracking

## 2026-01-15 19:10 - US-007
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created AddPlayerForm client component (implemented alongside US-006)
- Form fields: firstName, lastName, jerseyNumber with required validation
- Submit calls createPlayer action, success triggers onSuccess callback
- Error state displayed when creation fails
- Loading state with "Adding..." text while submitting
- Cancel button to close without adding
- Files changed: components/onboarding/add-player-form.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use form action={handleSubmit} with FormData for server actions
  - useTransition provides isPending state for loading indicators
  - onSuccess callback pattern allows parent to update state (add to selected list)

## 2026-01-15 19:30 - US-008
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Modified auth callback to redirect new users without linked players
- After auth completes, queries UserPlayer table to check for linked players
- If no linked players: redirects to /onboarding/player
- If has linked players: redirects to / (existing behavior)
- Refactored auth callback to reduce cognitive complexity (extracted helper functions)
- Files changed: app/auth/callback/route.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `ReturnType<typeof createServerClient>` for Supabase client type (not exported directly from @supabase/ssr)
  - Extract helper functions to reduce cognitive complexity below 20 (Biome limit)
  - Result types with discriminated unions: `{ userId: number } | { error: NextResponse }` for typed error handling
  - For new user inserts, chain `.select("id").single()` to get the auto-generated ID
  - On error checking linked players, default to allowing access (return true) to avoid blocking users
